This morning I came into the office and I wanted a test Glean. This is the natural language question that I asked.

I want to know yesterday how many people fully onboarded, what the CAC cost was, and broken down by the channels. I want to make a reference point to what the CAC was yesterday and the rest of the month.
And I also want to figure out how many people came to we.money and applied by a bright match; how many people dropped off; how many people would have been eligible for a lender but didn't go through the funnel, and I want to say that broken down by the credit score and the type of debt profiles they have.
I want to figure out where the RPM is and to determine the missed opportunity for revenue based on the people that we could have helped but didn't because

I then restructured this into Claude to provide me a structured breakdown.

Here's your question refined into WeMoney vernacular:

Daily Performance & CAC Analysis
FOBM Volume (Yesterday)Total FOBMs acquired yesterday
CAC by acquisition channel breakdown
CAC comparison: yesterday vs MTD average
BrightMatch Funnel Analysis (Yesterday)we.money visitors → BrightMatch applications (conversion rate)
Application drop-off points and volume at each stage
"Lender-eligible but unconverted" cohort:
Breakdown by credit score band
Breakdown by debt profile type (e.g., personal loan, credit card, BNPL consolidation)
Revenue Opportunity GapCurrent RPM
Missed revenue calculation: eligible-but-unconverted users × potential RPM
Revenue leakage by credit score band and debt profile

Want me to search Amplitude for existing dashboards or charts that track these metrics, or help you build a new analysis?

Then I asked based on my feedback yesterday

Got it. Based on your GLEAN feedback from yesterday, here's how you'd phrase these questions for the natural language data agent:

GLEAN Queries (Natural Language)
Query 1: Daily FOBM & CAC
"How many members fully onboarded yesterday? What was the CAC broken down by acquisition channel, and how does yesterday's CAC compare to the month-to-date average?"
Query 2: BrightMatch Funnel Performance
"Yesterday, how many visitors came to we.money and started a BrightMatch application? Of those, how many dropped off at each stage, and how many were eligible for at least one lender but didn't complete the funnel?"
Query 3: Drop-off Segmentation
"For the lender-eligible members who didn't convert yesterday, break them down by credit score band and debt profile type."
Query 4: Revenue Opportunity Gap
"What's our current RPM? Based on the eligible-but-unconverted members yesterday, what's the missed revenue opportunity?"

The "Mary Journey" Version
If GLEAN is built with the ontology layer you recommended, the killer question becomes:
"Which members visited BrightMatch yesterday, would have been approved by at least one lender, but didn't apply—and what should we do about them?"
That's the shift from retrieval to action-oriented outcomes you pushed David on.

Want me to also draft this as a test case brief for the GLEAN build?
